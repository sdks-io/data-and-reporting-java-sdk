You must provide credentials in the client as shown in the following code snippet.

```java
ShellDataReportingAPIsClient client = new ShellDataReportingAPIsClient.Builder()
    .basicAuthCredentials(new BasicAuthModel.Builder(
            "Username",
            "Password"
        )
        .build())
    .build();
```
